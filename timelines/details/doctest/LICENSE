The library is heavily influenced by Catch - https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2
which uses the Boost Software License - Version 1.0
see here - https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/LICENSE.txt

The concept of subcases (sections in Catch) and expression decomposition are from there.
Some parts of the code are taken directly:
- stringification - the detection of "ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const T&)" and StringMaker<>
- the Approx() helper class for floating point comparison
- colors in the console
- breaking into a debugger
- signal / SEH handling
- timer
- XmlWriter class - thanks to Phil Nash for allowing the direct reuse (AKA copy/paste)

The expression decomposing templates are taken from lest - https://github.com/martinmoene/lest
which uses the Boost Software License - Version 1.0
